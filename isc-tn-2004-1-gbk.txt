摘要

   This paper describes an approach for deploying authoritative name
   servers using a cluster of hosts, across which the load of client
   requests is distributed. DNS services deployed in this fashion enjoy
   high availability and are also able to scale to increasing request
   loads in a straightforward manner.

   The approach described here does not employ any custom load-balancing
   appliances (e.g. devices commonly marketed as as "layer-four
   switches", "content switches" or "load-balancers"); instead the
   individual members of the cluster announce a service address to one
   or more gateway routers by participating in routing protocols to
   provide an intra-cluster anycast architecture.

   Load-balancing appliances can sometimes present single points of
   failure to a cluster. This problem is avoided using the technique
   described in this paper; the only components required to construct
   the cluster are the hosts that provide the service, and one or more
   gateway routers which provide access to the rest of the Internet.

   The coupling between the DNS software and the routing software needs
   to be sufficiently robust to ensure that a service address is not
   advertised while requests cannot be satisfied. This includes a
   description of a technique for announcing and withdrawing the route
   for a service address such that availability of the service in the
   routing system is coupled with the ability to answer requests on
   individual hosts in the cluster.

   The F Root Name Server [9] is deployed using clusters built in this
   fashion, using FreeBSD [10], GNU Zebra [11] and ISC BIND 9 [12].

1. 设计目标

   This paper describes a alternative to the deployment of individual
   authoritative DNS [3] servers which seeks to achieve the following:

   Reliability: The DNS service should be highly available, and should
      hence survive both unplanned single-point events such as hardware
      failures, and also planned maintenance which might cause
      individual components to become unavailable.
   Integrity: Software problems on individual hosts in the cluster
      should result in the corresponding hosts being automatically
      removed from service, so their impact on the service being
      provided is minimised.
   Scalability: The DNS service should be capable of scaling to handle
      very high request loads without requiring very high performance on
      individual hosts. In combination with the reliability requirement
      above, upgrades to allow increasing request loads to be handled
      should be possible without making the service unavailable.

   The architecture described in this paper could also be applied to
   other services. DNS, however, is ideally suited to this approach by
   virtue of its stateless (or stateful but short-lived) transactions;
   other protocols with different characteristics may not fare as well.
   See Section 6.4 for more discussion.

   The use of this technique for load-balancing authoritative DNS
   service has been widely tested in the field by ISC in the deployment
   of the F root name server.

2. General Approach

   One or more routers are connected to a common, multi-access network
   such as a single VLAN on an Ethernet switch. Two or more hosts are
   also connected to this common subnet (see Figure 1).

                                Figure 1

   Individual interfaces on hosts and routers are configured with
   globally-unique addresses, such that each interface on each component
   can be addressed unambiguously by other devices on the Internet.
   These unicast addresses are used for management and other non-service
   traffic.

   A service is associated with an IPv4 or IPv6 service address. This
   address is different to any of the addresses configured on any of the
   router or host interfaces described above.

   Each host is configured with a dedicated software loopback interface,
   on which just the service address is configured.
   每台主机配置成带有一个专门的软件环回接口，在接口上配置有服务地址。

   The routers and hosts are all configured to participate in an OSPF
   [5] backbone area, through which hosts signal reachability of the
   service loopback address using OSPF Link State Advertisements (LSAs).
   路由器和主机都配置到一个OSPF骨干区域中，通过这个区域，主机使用OSPF链路
   状态广告（LSA）通知服务环回地址的可达性。

   Requests from clients are sent to the service address. Each request
   will be delivered to a single host for processing, and hence the DNS
   software on each host should be configured to listen for requests on
   that service address. Responses from the host being sent back to a
   client are generated with the source address set to the service
   address.
   来自

   Non-service traffic sent from outside the cluster to individual hosts
   (e.g. management traffic) is directed to the globally-unique, unicast
   address of each host. Corresponding response traffic originated from
   the host is sourced from that unicast address, and not the service
   address.




Abley                                                           [Page 4]

                         DNS Load Distribution                March 2004


   Each router provides routes to the rest of the Internet, probably
   including a gateway of last resort.

   Each router now enjoys multiple paths to the service address, learnt
   through OSPF. The routers are configured to route packets destined
   for the service address using some appropriate heuristic to obtain
   the desired load-balancing (see Section 3.2).

3. Routing Details

3.1 General

   In the context of OSPF, each host is a router advertising
   availability of a link connected to a distant common subnet which
   covers the service address. The SPF algorithm when run on the two
   gateway routers (labelled "router 1", "router 2", etc. in Figure 1)
   yields multiple, equal-cost candidate routes for the service address;
   these are described as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routes in the
   OSPF specification.

   The host route for the service address is anycast within the routing
   system of the cluster. The service address may appear to be a unicast
   system as viewed from the Internet as a whole, or the cluster may be
   one of many providing the same service as part of a distributed,
   Internet-wide anycast deployment [7].

3.2 Gateway Routers

   It is a requirement that the gateway routers used in the cluster are
   able to make use of all available ECMP routes. Although supported by
   OSPF, availability of ECMP support may be limited by the routing
   architecture of the system on which OSPF is implemented: for example,
   some operating systems cannot accommodate more than one route to a
   single destination.

3.2.1 Stateless Transactions

   For DNS requests carried over UDP [1] with no fragmentation, an
   entire transaction consists of a single-packet request followed by a
   single-packet response. The protocol is stateless and it is
   acceptable for subsequent packets sent to the service address by the
   same client to be delivered to different hosts. Any route selection
   algorithm on the gateway routers will provide an distribution of
   request traffic which allows DNS transactions to proceed.







Abley                                                           [Page 5]

3.2.2 Stateful Transactions

3.2.2.1 Flow Hashing

   DNS transactions which require multiple packets to be exchanged
   between client and server cannot accommodate successive packets being
   delivered to different hosts. This is the case, for example, for DNS
   transactions which are performed over TCP [2], since state is
   maintained on an individual host between packets for a single
   transaction.

   For DNS transactions carried over TCP it is necessary to associate a
   single route from the set of candidate ECMP routes with all packets
   associated with a single transaction (a "flow"). Cisco routers using
   Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) [8] are able to associate a hash of
   (source, destination) internet- and transport-layer addresses with a
   single route, which satisfies this requirement.

   CEF's route selection algorithm is stateless and deterministic for a
   stable set of ECMP routes. In general, however, a change in the
   number or ordering of those routes may cause the route selected for a
   particular (source, destination) hash to change. This fragility
   should be considered when gauging whether this load distribution
   approach is appropriate to particular protocols. See Section 6 for
   further discussion.

   Juniper routers can be configured with "load-balance per-packet"
   which, on routers with the Internet Processor II ASIC, provides
   similar forwarding behaviour to that described for CEF.

   Load distribution between hosts using flow-hashing forwarding
   algorithms will tend to be uneven in terms of traffic presented. The
   degenerate, illustrative case of this is a single host sending a
   stream of requests to the service address from a consistent source
   port: requests will always be answered by a single host, since the
   (source, destination) hash will always select a single route. See
   also Section 6.1.

3.2.2.2 Upstream Router Considerations

   Different gateway routers will, in general, map the same (source,
   destination) hashes to different candidate routes, since the ordering
   of ECMP routes in each router will be different. In order to ensure
   that packets from a single flow are routed to a single host for
   processing it is necessary that all the packets enter the cluster via
   the same gateway router.





Abley                                                           [Page 6]

                         DNS Load Distribution                March 2004


   This imposes the requirement on upstream routers that the route to
   the service address be stable for a single flow, which can be
   accommodated, for example, by having those routers use flow hashing
   forwarding algorithms with ECMP routes, or routing protocols which
   explicitly deny ECMP such as standard BGP [4] without multipath
   extensions.

3.2.3 Example Configurations

   Example configurations for cisco and Juniper gateway routers can be
   found in Appendix A.

3.3 Hosts

   Hosts do not share the forwarding requirements described in Section
   3.2; datagrams sourced from the hosts are unambiguously addressed to
   the unicast addresses of clients, and any equal-cost route diversity
   in the path back to those clients will inevitably converge on a
   single device.

   The availability of the DNS service on a particular host is signalled
   to the gateway routers by issuing an LSA through which the service
   address is reachable. Correspondingly, the non-availability of the
   DNS service is signalled by issuing an LSA which withdraws the route,
   as if the link between the "host" router and the service address had
   been severed.

   The straightforward requirements for the host's routing ability are
   easily satisfied by unix-based OSPF implementations such as the one
   included in GNU Zebra. An example configuration for GNU Zebra can be
   found in Appendix B.

4. Host Operating System Considerations

   The operating systems used on the hosts support cloneable Loopback
   interfaces, and a dedicated software loopback address is created and
   configured with the service address. The availability or
   non-availability of the DNS service is then signalled to the OSPF
   process on the host by simply raising or lowering the interface (e.g.
   "ifconfig lo1 up", "ifconfig lo1 down").

   Nodes of the F root name server are hosted on FreeBSD 4 (with support
   for cloneable loopback interfaces added) and FreeBSD 5 (which
   supports cloneable loopback interfaces as released).

5. Name Server Considerations

5.1 General Configuration

   The DNS software running on the host is configured to:

   1.  bind to the service address, configured on a loopback address on
       the local host, and listen for client requests;
   2.  bind to the unicast address of the host's interface on the
       cluster subnet at all other times (e.g. to perform zone
       transfers).

5.2 Zone Transfers

   Special consideration may be required to accommodate zone transfers
   from master services which provide access control based on source
   address.

   In the case where a master server insists that a slave server's
   service address be used to source a zone transfer request, it will
   frequently be the case that traffic from the master server will be
   delivered to a different host from the host which originated the
   request. Zone transfers in this case will time out.

   In an N-host cluster (assuming random distribution of flow hashes on
   the gateway routers) one zone transfer request in N can be expected
   to succeed from any host. To help ensure that the transferred data is
   available quickly to all hosts in the cluster, each host can be
   configured to attempt zone transfers from the master server and also
   from each other.

   Some slave name servers may be configured to perform zone transfers
   from a mixture of master servers which accept zone transfer requests
   sourced only from the service address, and others which accept zone
   transfer requests sourced from individual hosts' unicast addresses.
   To facilitate this ISC BIND 8 and ISC BIND 9 will attempt zone
   transfers from their configured "transfer-source" address first, and
   will retry using an unbound socket if the first attempt fails. Using
   an unbound socket has the effect in this case of sourcing the zone
   transfer request from the local unicast address.

   Where zone transfers are authenticated using methods which do not
   rely on source address checking (e.g. using TSIG [6]), or where zone
   transfers are not authenticated, zone transfer requests may be
   sourced from hosts' unicast addresses and the concerns described here
   are avoided.

5.3 Self-Consistency

   ISC BIND 9 is designed in such a way that anomalous run-time
   conditions which might lead to defective behaviour cause the named
   process to terminate. This facilitates a straightforward automatic
   control mechanism to allow the advertisement of the service to be
   tightly coupled to the availability of the DNS software, using a
   wrapper script similar to that shown in Appendix D.

5.4 Troubleshooting

   For troubleshooting purposes, it is sometimes useful to be able to
   identify the individual host in a cluster which is servicing a
   particular client. ISC BIND 9 will answer a query for a TXT record in
   the CHAOS class for "HOSTNAME.BIND" with RDATA coresponding to the
   local hostname (see Figure 2).

         $ dig +short @F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET HOSTNAME.BIND CH TXT
         "sfo2a.f.root-servers.org"
         $

                                Figure 2

   Support for the "HOSTNAME.BIND" query is included in ISC BIND 8 (all
   versions) and ISC BIND 9 (from version 9.3).

5.5 Example Configuration

   Example configuration for ISC BIND 9 [12] can be found in Appendix C.

6. Limitations

6.1 Load Balancing

   The load distribution scheme is limited by the ECMP route selection
   algorithm used in the gateway routers. More sophisticated
   load-balancing algorithms are supported by dedicated load-balancing
   appliances (e.g. "least loaded server", "least recently used
   server").

6.2 Service Monitoring

   The integrity of the service is sustained by rigourous checks on
   configuration files prior to the service starting, coupled with the
   self-consistency checks in ISC BIND 9 which cause the process to exit
   if they fail. External consistency checks are possible based on
   transactions against individual hosts' unicast address, and against
   the service address in general. Testing transactions directed at the



Abley                                                           [Page 9]

                         DNS Load Distribution                March 2004


   service address on specific hosts is not straightforward due to the
   anycast routing of the service address.

6.3 Host Identification

   Although the HOSTNAME.BIND lookup illustrated in Figure 2 provides
   some degree of diagnostic support to troubleshooting, it is not
   possible in general to determine the precise host which served a
   response to a particular DNS query without resorting to packet
   capture or expensive query logging on every host which is able to
   provide service to a client. This is an issue common to all load
   balancing techniques, and not just the one described in this paper.

   At the time of writing work is underway to extend EDNS to provide a
   method to identify individual hosts from transaction response data.

6.4 Applicability to Other Protocols

   DNS request and response traffic has the characteristic that
   transactions tend to be short-lived, and are executed rapidly. Other
   protocols whose transactions are longer lived may suffer from
   changing flow hash results as the ECMP route set changes; this might
   happen, for example, following LSAs sent from a host whose DNS
   service is taken down for maintenance, due to a failure in an
   individual host or because the cluster is being enlarged.

   The deployment of the F root name server using the technique
   described in this paper provides data to suggest that this technique
   is effective for DNS service; those wishing to deploy protocols whose
   transactions are substantially different in nature to DNS are advised
   to test thoroughly.
